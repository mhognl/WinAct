# WinAct
Windows Activation program.

I decided to share this project. The main goal is make your own custom script (which means changing things according to your likings). I will describe how below.

## $OEM$ folder
Extract the $OEM$ folder till you've the following folder structure: $OEM$\$$\Setup\Scripts. In there you will find 'SetupComplete.cmd'.
Open the file with your favourite text or code editor (I recommend using Notepad++). Add to the line KMS_ADDR= your own KMS IP and add to KMS_KEY= the KMS keys you have.

I want to give you a KMS address you can use (itÂ´s my own): vps.maxhog.nl

Put the $OEM$ folder in usb_root\sources

Later I will add some KMS keys and maybe more scripts.
