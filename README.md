# WinAct
Windows Activation program.

I decided to share this project. The main goal is make your own custom script (which means changing things according to your likings). I will describe how below.

> ## "$OEM$" folder
Extract the "$OEM$" folder till you've the following folder structure: "$OEM$"\\$$\Setup\Scripts.
In there you will find 'SetupComplete.cmd'.
Open the file with your favourite text or code editor (I recommend using Notepad++). Add to the line KMS_ADDR= your own KMS IP and add to KMS_KEY= the KMS keys you have.

Put the "$OEM$" folder in usb_root\sources

## ei.cfg file
If you donÂ´t want to customize the folder then use the file "$OEM$"-W10-and-W11-Pro.7z. Extract it and put it in the usb_root\sources folder. Also add ei.cfg to usb_root\sources.

### Happy Hacking!
